RSA Cryptography (Instructions to run project are given at the bottom of the document.)

This project is based on verilog implementation of RSA encryption , it is a widely known cybersecurity practice which involves 
use of public and private keys (cryptography). to calculate decryption key 'd' and encryption key 'e' we use extended euclidian algorithm  
i.e  d * e = 1 mod (phi)

//Concept of RSA cryptography
OUTPUT is based on the rules (below is an example of general rsa cryptosytem(not bit specific)):
>> Generating Public Key :
Select two prime no's. Suppose P = 53 and Q = 59.
Now First part of the Public key  : n = P*Q = 3127.
 We also need a small exponent say e : *But e Must be An integer, *Not be a factor of n. 
1 < e < Φ(n) [Φ(n) is discussed below], Let us now consider it to be equal to 3.
Our Public Key is made of n and e.

>> Generating Private Key :
We need to calculate Φ(n) :
Such that Φ(n) = (P-1)(Q-1)     
      so,  Φ(n) = 3016
    
>>Now calculate Private Key, d : 
d = (k*Φ(n) + 1) / e for some integer k
For k = 2, value of d is 2011.

>>//For Example:: (Now we are ready with our – Public Key ( n = 3127 and e = 3) and Private Key(d = 2011) as above)
Now we will encrypt “HI” :
Convert letters to numbers : H  = 8 and I = 9
Thus Encrypted Data c = 89^e mod n. 
Thus our Encrypted Data comes out to be 1394

>>Now we will decrypt 1394 : 
Decrypted Data = c^d mod n. 
Thus our Encrypted Data comes out to be 89
8 = H and I = 9 i.e. "HI".


INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROJECT:
1. Open "main" directory.
2. Inside it are 2 files, main.v and testbench.v
3. Use main.v as the design file and testbench.v as testbench.
4. There are some sample inputs inside testbench, but you can modify them according to need.
5. Run on Icarus Verilog 0.10.x simulator and use encrypt_decrypt=1 for encryption or encrypt_decrypt=0 for decryption.
6. Source directory also contains all module definitions.
